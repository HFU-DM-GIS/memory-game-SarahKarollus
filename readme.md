## Bug reports

### Bug #01 Card layout not random
The cards are always at the same position and hence there is no fun to play.
#### how to reproduce
The cards are always `[1][2][3][4][1][2][3][4]`.
#### how to solve
Add some random positions to the cards. Note that it makes sense to first generate a randomized list of all positions and then place the cards.

## Tasks
1. Fix all bugs mentioned above.  [DONE]
2. Replace the numbers on the cards with images.  [DONE]
3. Let the user change the number of cards to play with.
4. (Optional) Add a timer and save the times to finish in a leaderboard.
5. Add a flipping animation for the cards.
6. Use images that are taken from [the Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation#get-a-random-photo). Let the user choose a theme (query) and then get enough images for the cards.
